### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble changing the size of the cells in the collection view. I followed the instructions from the video (using the flow layout object) but the cell remained in the default size when simluating. But I found a way to fix this by navigating to the size inspector tab of the Collection View Flow Layout and changing the Estimate Size setting to None.
